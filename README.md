 Hi there!
This classifer was trained on the model.

Due to Github's file size limitation, the parameter h5 file and the dataset are not included in this repo. To test the Flask app yourself: 
- Save the h5 file to _static_ folder
- In your terminal, navigate to this folder then type `python3 app.py`

__Note:__ 
- You might need to install some additional Python libraries. Check at `app.py`.
- This app is using Tensorflow.
